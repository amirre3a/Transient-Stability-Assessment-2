# Transient-Stability-Assessment-CCT

Calculation of Speed and Rotor Angle Variations of an SMIB Generator Model Using Numerical Solution of Its Differential Equations with Trapezoidal Method for Different Critical Clearing Times, with Time Increments of 10 Milliseconds and Repeating until it Reaches the CCT Time

The numerical values for calculations for each fault clearing time should be recorded in a separate Excel sheet, and speed and angle curves should be plotted against time for each.
